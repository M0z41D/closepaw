# Changelog

## 2026-03-06: Local Parallel Eval Workflow

**What changed:**
- Hardened `eval/aw_bridge/parallel_runner.py` so the supervisor owns one-time APK build/install, honors `runner.perform_bridge_setup`, and merges results back into `eval/results/<run_id>/`.
- Added `scripts/eval_parallel.sh` as the standard local 2-device entry point for `AndroidWorldAvd` (`emulator-5554`) and `AndroidWorldAvd2` (`emulator-5556`).
- Updated eval docs plus `/autotune` and `/cog-tune` guidance to use the standard result contract and the new local parallel workflow.

**Why:**
- Cut eval wall-clock time with a real local parallel path without creating a second result format or breaking downstream tooling such as `scoreboard.py` and eval analysis flows.

## 2026-03-06: Prompt Ownership Refactor

**What changed:**
- Added asset-backed app skills under `app/src/main/assets/app_skills/` and load them per turn from the current foreground package.
- Injected the active app skill into the prompt between Working Memory and Observation.
- Rewrote the standalone and planner system prompts around cross-tool policy instead of app/tool-specific appendices.
- Expanded tool descriptions so `mobile_action`, `open_app`, `shell`, and `complete_task` own their local semantics.

**Why:**
- Separate global behavior, tool semantics, and app-specific knowledge so tuning changes land in one clear owner layer instead of accumulating in one monolithic prompt.

**Key files:** `app/src/main/kotlin/com/moonkey/androidagent/agent/cognition/prompt/AppSkillRepository.kt`, `app/src/main/kotlin/com/moonkey/androidagent/agent/TurnPlanningPhaseRunner.kt`, `app/src/main/kotlin/com/moonkey/androidagent/agent/definition/StandaloneAgentDef.kt`, `app/src/main/kotlin/com/moonkey/androidagent/agent/definition/PlannerAgentDef.kt`, `app/src/main/assets/app_skills/`
